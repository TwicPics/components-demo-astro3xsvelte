### What is [TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=components)?

[TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=components) is a **Responsive Image Service Solution** (SaaS) that enables **on-demand responsive image generation**.

With [TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=components), developers only deal with high-resolution versions of their media while end-users receive **optimized, perfectly sized, device-adapted** versions **delivered from a server close to them**.

[TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=components) acts as an **image proxy**. It requests your master image, be it on your own web server, cloud storage or DAM, then generates a **device-adapted** version with **best-in-class compression**, delivered directly to the end-user from the **closest delivery point** available.

### What is TwicPics Components?

TwicPics Components is a **collection of web components** that make it dead easy to unleash the power of [TwicPics](https://www.twicpics.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=components) in your own projects.

Basically, TwicPics components replace `img` and `video` tags. They greatly and transparently optimize your CLS by providing LQIP (Low-Quality Image Placeholders) and Lazy Loading out of the box.

Simply replace this:

```html
<img src="https://assets.twicpics.com/examples/football.jpg" />
```

With this:

```html
<TwicImg src="https://assets.twicpics.com/examples/football.jpg" />
```

Thanks to the open source [TwicPics Components](https://www.twicpics.com/docs/essentials/components?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=components#components), delivering responsive images in your [Astro.js](https://astro.build/) projects has never been easier.
